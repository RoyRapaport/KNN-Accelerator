## 📊 Presentations

### 1. Frontend Design & Architecture
**File:** `KNN Presentation - Front-end.pptx`
* **KNN Algorithm Overview**: The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric, supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It predicts the category of a test point by identifying its K closest neighbors in an n-dimensional feature space. In this design, the system compares the test point against 128 labeled training points to find the majority group among the 5 nearest neighbors.
  
Highlights the design phase and functional verification of the accelerator.
* **Architecture**: Breakdown of the 4-way parallel distance calculation and the 3-phase Bitonic Sort network.
* **Verification Logic**: Utilization of **Synopsys VCS** for simulation and **SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)** for protocol checking.


### 2. Backend & Physical Implementation
**File:** `KNN Presentation - Back-end.pptx`
Focuses on the physical realization of the chip in **TSMC 65nm** technology.
* **Synthesis & Optimization**: Using **Synopsys Design Compiler** to reach a 100MHz target frequency.
* **Logical Equivalence**: Verification of RTL vs. Netlist using **Cadence Conformal LEC**.
* **Physical Implementation**: 
    * **Floorplan**: 48 I/O pads with optimized power ring distribution.
    * **CTS**: Balanced clock tree with **60ps skew** and **280ps insertion delay**.
    * **Utilization**: Core density set at **0.35** to mitigate IR drop and congestion.
* **Sign-off Analysis**:
